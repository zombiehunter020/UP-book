# Unit Project 2 - University Prep Book

Create a social media platform for University Prep Charter High School.

## Your Project

Sadly, as seniors, you are experiencing some of your final days as a high school stuents without the friends you have made at University Prep over the last four years. 

As a result, for this project we will design a social media platform for University Prep so we can remember some of the amazing people you have met on your journey at this school.

## Tasks

1. Add profiles - 40 points

In the students array, add at least 8 students from University Prep that you would like to use for this project. As I said in the video, you will need to include a profile picture, name, quote, and superlative for each person.

2. Add style - 30 points

Add at least 80 lines of style to this project to get full credit. You can style the buttons, the profile, the title, add a background, or whatever else you can think of to make this page asthetically pleasing.

3. Add polish - 20 points

As I stated in the video, if you keep clicking the next button - when you get to the end of the array you will get an error because there are no more profiles to show. The same is true if you keep clicking the back button. When the last person in the array is reached, the program should skip to the first profile. When the first person in the array is reached, the program should skip to the last profile.

4. Add a new feature - 10 points

Finally, you should add a new feature to this project. This can be ANYTHING you dream up. Perhaps you create a new button that shows a random student when it is clicked. Or when you click the profile image of the student it changes the background of the website to their picture. The possibilities are endless! Be creative as you like with this.

5. BONUS - 30 Points

Create a form at the top of the page that allows the user to input a new student to the program.
